## Get

### When's the release?

When `Code.gs` gets uploaded.

### Google Workspace Marketplace

Get it from the Google Workspace Marketplace by going to Add-Ons -> Get add-ons, then search BetterTemplate

### App Script Project

If you can't get it from the Google Workspace Marketplace, go to [App Script](https://script.google.com), create a new project, then paste the code in.

This method is more tedious, as you must add the document you want to use it with following [this](https://tutorials.viscerality.me/bettertemplate) tutorial.

## FAQ

### Custom colors won't work, what should I do?

You probably didn't add the # in your hex code (#FF0000, not FF0000). Retry it, and if it still doesn't work, try again later then open an issue.

### Standard color changes (default black/red) won't work, what should I do?

Try again later, make sure you gave access [here](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions), then open an issue.

### When's the Coming Soon features coming out?

Sometime between the next instant and the heat death of the universe.

### You're the guy who hates Comic Sans, will this remove Comic Sans from my document on use?

Correct, I hate Comic Sans.
No, it would be too annoying for me to make it remove text by font category.
No, I have no plans to make it remove Comic Sans.
